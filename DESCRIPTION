Description: Persistence data (often equated with persistence diagrams) are
    difficult to couple with statistical tools and machine learning approaches.
    Bubenik (2015) <arXiv:1207.6437> introduced persistence landscapes to
    address this problem by encoding persistence data as functions with a
    Hilbert space structure. As such, they admit linear operations, an inner
    product, and desirable statistical properties like a central limit theorem.
    Bubenik and Dłotko (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jsc.2016.03.009> developed the
    Persistence Landscapes Toolbox to facilitate computational work with
    persistence landscapes. These included calculations of distance, a null
    hypothesis testing procedure, and a support vector machine classifier. Core
    functionality was exported to R in the 'tda-tools' package by Bouza, from
    which this package is adapted.
